# [React Native CPH - Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/React-Native-CPH)
## [Hacknight 21st October 2016](https://www.meetup.com/React-Native-CPH/events/233763008/)
### Topic: "Am I really attending this meetup?"

---

### Goal

The goal is to create an app in 4hours. We will be using the Meetup API and build an app where the user can see his/her own events and RVSP to each event.

### User stories

1. As a user, I should see all my upcoming events in a ListView;
2. As a user, I should be able to update my RVSP to upcoming events from the ListView mentioned in 1.;
3. As a user I should see the attendees of an event, displayed in a new view; 

### HOWTO Meetup Api

1. Get own key: [https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/)
2. GET RNCPH event info: [https://api.meetup.com/react-native-cph/events?member_id=self&key=](https://api.meetup.com/react-native-cph/events?member_id=self&key=)
3. UPDATE RSVSP: [https://api.meetup.com/react-native-cph/events/233763008/rsvps?sign=true&key=&response=yes)](https://api.meetup.com/react-native-cph/events/233763008/rsvps?sign=true&key=&response=yes)
