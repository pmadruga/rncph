# [React Native CPH - Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/React-Native-CPH)
## [Hacknight 21st October 2016](https://www.meetup.com/React-Native-CPH/events/233763008/)
### Topic: "Am I really attending this meetup?"

---

### Goal
The goal is to create an app in 4hours. We will be using the Meetup API and build an app that asks the user if he is really going to an event. In 4 hours. :-)

### User stories

1. As a user attending the RN meetup, I should be able to RSVP from within the app;
2. As a user, the app should remind me to update the RSVP hours before the event, 
3. As a user I should see the RSVPs to the event in a new view; 

### Relevant API endpoints

1. GET: [Events for a certain group](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/:urlname/events/#list)
2. POST: [Updating RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/2/rsvp/)

### Guesstimations

1. Reading Documentation, testing the API (45m)
2. Implementation (2h)
3. Optional: Presentation if desired (5m / group = 30m)
